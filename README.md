Certainly! Here is a more detailed report on the TCP Server with client application:

### **Detailed Report on TCP Server and Client Application**

---

### **1. Overview:**

The provided Go application implements a TCP server-client chat system with features like multiple chat rooms, user management (kick and ban), and a basic bot. The server and client use TLS for secure communication, ensuring that data transmitted between them is encrypted.

---

### **2. Components:**

#### **Server (`server.go`):**

**Key Features:**
- **TLS Encryption:** Ensures secure communication by using TLS.
- **Multi-room Support:** Users can create and join multiple chat rooms.
- **User Management:** Users can be kicked or banned from chat rooms.
- **Bot Integration:** A simple bot that can respond to predefined messages.
- **Notification System:** Alerts for user connection, disconnection, and typing status.

**Main Functions:**

- **main():**
  - Initializes TLS certificates.
  - Listens for incoming TCP connections on port 3334.
  - Spawns a new goroutine to handle each connection.

- **handleConnection(conn net.Conn):**
  - Manages an individual user's connection.
  - Reads and processes user commands.
  - Routes messages to the appropriate functions (e.g., createRoom, joinRoom, broadcastMessage).

- **createRoom(conn net.Conn, roomName string):**
  - Creates a new chat room.
  - Adds the room to the `chatRooms` map.

- **joinRoom(conn net.Conn, roomName string, room **ChatRoom):**
  - Adds a user to an existing chat room.
  - Checks if the user is banned from the room.

- **broadcastMessage(conn net.Conn, message string):**
  - Sends a message to all members of the chat room that the user is in.

- **banUser(conn net.Conn, userAddr string):**
  - Bans a user from the chat room.
  - Removes the user from the chat room's members list and adds them to the banned list.

- **kickUser(conn net.Conn, userAddr string):**
  - Kicks a user out of the chat room.
  - Removes the user from the chat room's members list.

- **notifyConnection(conn net.Conn) and notifyDisconnection(conn net.Conn):**
  - Broadcasts user connection and disconnection messages to all chat rooms.

- **notifyTyping(conn net.Conn):**
  - Sends a typing notification to all users in the chat room.

- **addBot():**
  - Activates a simple bot that responds to specific messages.

#### **Client (`client.go`):**

**Key Features:**
- **TLS Encryption:** Uses TLS for secure communication.
- **User Interaction:** Provides a command-line interface for user input and output.
- **Typing Notification:** Sends typing status to the server.

**Main Functions:**

- **main():**
  - Loads TLS certificates.
  - Connects to the server using TLS.
  - Spawns goroutines to handle reading from and writing to the server.

- **Read(conn net.Conn):**
  - Continuously reads messages from the server.
  - Prints received messages to the console.

- **Write(conn net.Conn):**
  - Continuously reads user input from the console.
  - Sends user input to the server.
  - Sends a typing notification when the user starts typing.

- **notifyTyping(conn net.Conn):**
  - Sends a typing status message to the server.

### **3. Detailed Functionality:**

**3.1 Server Functionality:**

- **TLS Setup:**
  - Loads server certificates (`server.crt` and `server.key`) for secure communication.
  - Creates a TLS listener on port 3334.

- **Connection Handling:**
  - For each new connection, the server spawns a goroutine (`handleConnection`) to manage the connection.
  - Connections are handled concurrently using goroutines.

- **Command Processing:**
  - Commands are prefixed with a `/` (e.g., `/create`, `/join`).
  - Commands include:
    - `/create <room>`: Creates a new chat room.
    - `/join <room>`: Joins an existing chat room.
    - `/msg <message>`: Sends a message to the chat room.
    - `/kick <User IP:Port>`: Kicks a user from the chat room.
    - `/ban <User IP:Port>`: Bans a user from the chat room.
    - `/addbot`: Adds a bot to the chat room.
    - `/help`: Displays a list of available commands.

- **Chat Room Management:**
  - **Creating Rooms:** Adds a new room to the `chatRooms` map.
  - **Joining Rooms:** Adds the user to the room's members list.
  - **Broadcasting Messages:** Sends messages to all members of a chat room.
  - **Kicking/Banning Users:** Removes users from the room and optionally bans them.

- **Bot Functionality:**
  - A simple bot responds to the message "hello" with a greeting.

**3.2 Client Functionality:**

- **TLS Setup:**
  - Loads client certificates (`client.crt` and `client.key`) for secure communication.
  - Connects to the server using TLS.

- **Reading and Writing:**
  - **Reading:** Continuously reads and prints messages from the server.
  - **Writing:** Reads user input from the console, sends it to the server, and notifies the server when the user is typing.

- **User Interface:**
  - Simple command-line interface for entering commands and messages.

---

### **4. Security Considerations:**

- **TLS Encryption:** Ensures that all communication between the client and server is encrypted.
- **User Banning:** Prevents banned users from rejoining a chat room.
- **Authentication:** The current implementation does not include user authentication, which is a potential area for improvement.

---

### **5. Potential Improvements:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password) to restrict access to authorized users.

2. **Enhanced User Interface:**
   - Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.

3. **Message Formatting:**
   - Include timestamps, usernames, and other metadata in messages.

4. **Improved Bot Features:**
   - Enhance the bot to support more complex interactions and commands.

5. **Persistent Storage:**
   - Store chat history and user data in a database for persistence.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement more robust error handling to gracefully manage network and application errors.

7. **Scalability:**
   - Optimize the server to handle a larger number of concurrent connections.

8. **Logging:**
   - Add logging to track server activities, user actions, and errors for better monitoring and debugging.

9. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement additional security measures, such as rate limiting and IP blacklisting, to protect against abuse.

### **6. Conclusion:**

The TCP server-client chat application provides a foundational framework for building a chat system with secure communication, multi-room support, and basic user management features. While it includes essential functionalities like creating and joining chat rooms, sending messages, and managing users, there are several areas for potential improvement. Enhancing user authentication, interface, error handling, and scalability will make the application more robust and suitable for real-world deployment. With further development and refinements, this application can serve as a reliable and secure chat platform for various use cases.
